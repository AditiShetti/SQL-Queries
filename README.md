Contains a variety of SQL questions across topics like joins, aggregation, subqueries, and string functions.   



• I have completed the SQL tutorials on SQLBolt https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction.
  This was a good hands-on interactive activity to brush up the basics of sql for anyone. 
• I have also done most of the free  Questions on Analyst Builder. https://www.analystbuilder.com/questions?status=incomplete&accessType=free
  A few moderate and Hard questions are left.   
 
I plan to keep adding more queries that I find interesting .
